## Hello Octocat
I love Octocat. She's the coolest cat in town.

```{r quick_look, echo = TRUE}
data(anscombe)
dim(anscombe)
colnames(anscombe)
head(anscombe)
tail(anscombe)
summary(anscombe)
```

```{r xy_plot, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, fig.align='center', fig.path='figures/', dev='svg', echo=FALSE}
data(anscombe)
plot(anscombe$x1, anscombe$y1)
abline(lm(y1 ~ x1, data = anscombe))
```

##importing csv data
```{r data_import, echo=TRUE}
df <- read.csv("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/analgesic.csv")
```

##explore csv
```{r data_summary, echo=TRUE}
#dimensions
dim(df)

#column names
colnames(df)

#summarising
head(df)
tail(df)
summary(df)
```

##tidying data
```{r data_tidy, echo=TRUE}
#loading libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

#wide to long format
df_gathered <- gather(df, Measurement, Value, -ID, -Group)

#grouping by subject ID
df_grouped <- group_by(df_gathered, ID)

#summarizing: mean measurements for each subject
df_means <- summarize(df_grouped, mean(Value))
print(df_means)
```


##Data Set 1: Chicken Weights
```{r chicken_weights, echo=TRUE}
#loading data set
chickweight <- read.csv("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/chick-weights.csv?dl=1")

#Explore chicken weight data set with plot
plot(chickweight$feed, chickweight$weight, xlab = "Feed type", ylab = "Weight in grams")

#Null hypothesis: There is no difference in weight according to feed type after six weeks
#Alternative hypothesis: There is a difference in weight according to feed type after six weeks

#Analysis with the Kruskal-Wallis test: Assumes that weights are not normally distributed, data is unmatched, errors are independent and that each group has the same distribution
kruskal.test(weight ~ feed, data = chickweight)

#p-value<0.05, therefore the null hypothesis is rejected: weight of chicken is associated with feed type

#Post-Hoc analysis: From graphical analysis, Casein appears to produce the highest chick weights - casein will therefore be compared to each other feed type in order to ascertain whether this trend is statistically significant in each case.

#(1)Casein vs Horsebean
casein <- subset(chickweight, feed=="casein", select=weight)
horsebean <- subset(chickweight, feed=="horsebean", select=weight)
wilcox.test(casein$weight, horsebean$weight, alternative="greater", paired=FALSE)
#p-value<0.05, therefore casein produces a greater weight in chicks than does horsebean

#(2)Casein vs Linseed
linseed <- subset(chickweight, feed=="linseed", select=weight)
wilcox.test(casein$weight, linseed$weight, alternative="greater", paired=FALSE)
#p-value<0.05, therefore casein produces a greater weight in chicks than does linseed

#(3)Casein vs Meatmeal
meatmeal <- subset(chickweight, feed=="meatmeal", select=weight)
wilcox.test(casein$weight, meatmeal$weight, alternative="greater", paired=FALSE)
#p-value<0.05, therefore casein produces a greater weight in chicks than does meatmeal

#(4)Casein vs Soybean
soybean <- subset(chickweight, feed=="soybean", select=weight)
wilcox.test(casein$weight, soybean$weight, alternative="greater", paired=FALSE)
#p-value<0.05, therefore casein produces a greater weight in chicks than does soybean

#(5)Casein vs Sunflower
sunflower <- subset(chickweight, feed=="sunflower", select=weight)
wilcox.test(casein$weight, sunflower$weight, alternative="greater", paired=FALSE)
#p-value>0.05, therefore there is not a significant difference between the weight produced by casein and that produced by sunflower seed
```


##Data Set 2: The Hot Zone
```{r water_contam, echo=TRUE}
#loading data set
gastro <- read.csv("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/gastroenteritis.csv?dl=1")

#exploratory plot
plot(gastro)

#Null hypothesis: Proportion of ill people is independent of water intake
#Aternative hypothesis: Proportion of ill people is not independent of water intake

#contingency table of data
gastro_tbl <- table(gastro$Consumption, gastro$Outcome)
gastro_tbl

#analysis of independence by Chi-Squared Test: Assumes sample size is sufficiently large that expected values are > 5, and that data is unpaired
chisq.test(gastro_tbl)
#p-value<0.05 therefore null hypothesis is rejected: proportion of ill people is associated with amount of water intake. From the exploratory graph, it is evident that higher water intake is associated with a higher proportion of ill people.
```


##Data Set 3: Nausea
```{r nausea, echo=TRUE}
#loading data set
nausea <- read.csv("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/nausea.csv?dl=1")

#removing outlier
nausea_new <- subset(nausea, Nausea_after<=6, select=Patient:Nausea_after)
nausea_new

#creating a vector of means
nmeans <- c(mean(nausea_new$Nausea_before), mean(nausea_new$Nausea_after))

#bar plot of means
names(nmeans) <- c("Nausea before", "Nausea after")
barplot(nmeans)

#Null hypothesis: There is no difference in nausea ratings before vs after administration of the 5HT3 antagonist
#Alternative hypothesis: There is a difference in nausea ratings before vs after administration of the 5HT3 antagonist

#analysis by Wilcoxon test: assumes data is non-parametric, data is paired, errors are independent and samples have same distribution
wilcox.test(nausea_new$Nausea_before, nausea_new$Nausea_after, alternative="greater", paired = TRUE)
#p-value<0.05 therefore null hypothesis is rejected: Nausea ratings before vs after adminstration are different, nausea ratings before are greater than those after
```
