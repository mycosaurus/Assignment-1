## Hello Octocat
I love Octocat. She's the coolest cat in town.

```{r quick_look, echo = TRUE}
data(anscombe)
dim(anscombe)
colnames(anscombe)
head(anscombe)
tail(anscombe)
summary(anscombe)
```

```{r xy_plot, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, fig.align='center', fig.path='figures/', dev='svg', echo=FALSE}
data(anscombe)
plot(anscombe$x1, anscombe$y1)
abline(lm(y1 ~ x1, data = anscombe))
```

##importing csv data
```{r data_import, echo=TRUE}
df <- read.csv("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/analgesic.csv")
```

##explore csv
```{r data_summary, echo=TRUE}
#dimensions
dim(df)

#column names
colnames(df)

#summarising
head(df)
tail(df)
summary(df)
```

##tidying data
```{r data_tidy, echo=TRUE}
#loading libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

#wide to long format
df_gathered <- gather(df, Measurement, Value, -ID, -Group)

#grouping by subject ID
df_grouped <- group_by(df_gathered, ID)

#summarizing: mean measurements for each subject
df_means <- summarize(df_grouped, mean(Value))
print(df_means)
```


#Data Set 1: Chicken Weights
###Null hypothesis: There is no difference in weight according to feed type after six weeks
###Alternative hypothesis: There is a difference in weight according to feed type after six weeks
```{r chicken_weights, echo=TRUE}
#loading data set
chickweight <- read.csv("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/chick-weights.csv?dl=1")

#Explore chicken weight data set with plot
plot(chickweight$feed, chickweight$weight, xlab = "Feed type", ylab = "Weight in grams")

#Analysis with the Kruskal-Wallis test: Assumes that weights are not normally distributed, data is unmatched, errors are independent and that each group has the same distribution
kruskal.test(weight ~ feed, data = chickweight)
```
###p-value<0.05, therefore the null hypothesis is rejected: weight of chicken is associated with feed type


#Data Set 2: The Hot Zone
###Null hypothesis: Proportion of ill people is independent of water intake
###Alternative hypothesis: Proportion of ill people is not independent of water intake
```{r water_contam, echo=TRUE}
#loading data set
gastro <- read.csv("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/gastroenteritis.csv?dl=1")

#exploratory plot
plot(gastro)

#contingency table of data
gastro_tbl <- table(gastro$Consumption, gastro$Outcome)
gastro_tbl

#analysis of independence by Chi-Squared Test: Assumes sample size is sufficiently large that expected values are > 5, and that data is unpaired
chisq.test(gastro_tbl)
```
###p-value<0.05 therefore null hypothesis is rejected: proportion of ill people is associated with amount of water intake

#Data Set 3: Nausea
###Null hypothesis: There is no difference in nausea ratings before vs after administration of the 5HT3 antagonist
###Alternative hypothesis: There is a difference in nausea ratings before vs after administration of the 5HT3 antagonist
```{r nausea, echo=TRUE}
#loading data set
nausea <- read.csv("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/nausea.csv?dl=1")

#removing outlier
nausea_new <- subset(nausea, Nausea_after<=6, select=Patient:Nausea_after)
nausea_new

#creating a vector of means
nmeans <- c(mean(nausea_new$Nausea_before), mean(nausea_new$Nausea_after))

#bar plot of means
names(nmeans) <- c("Nausea before", "Nausea after")
barplot(nmeans)

#analysis by Wilcoxon test: assumes data is non-parametric, data is paired, errors are independent and samples have same distribution
wilcox.test(nausea_new$Nausea_before, nausea_new$Nausea_after, paired = TRUE)

```
###p-value<0.05 therefore null hypothesis is rejected: Nausea ratings before vs after administration are different
